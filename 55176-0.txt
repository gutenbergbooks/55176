A Word About the Wise


"A laugh," wrote the gentle and genial Charles Lamb, "is worth a
hundred groans in any market."

Our hard-headed and far-figuring men of business have been quick to
see and seize the truth of this great law of supply and demand. Being
themselves alert men of the market place, and appreciating fully
the melancholy world's urgent need of the titillating tonic called
laughter, they have cheerfully set to work to supply that need. The man
who laughs, they wisely argued, is the man who buys.

They required, however, in their altruistic schemes, just a little
assistance from their brothers of the pointed pens and the black ink
pots--the newspaper cartoonists. Would these kindly step forward and
help in a noble cause? Gaily these worthies sharpened their rusting
pens, right merrily they stirred the thickening ink, and here you have
the crystallization of their comic brew--a precious handful of gilded
homeopathic pills, sometimes called cartoons, which will prove to be a
sure cure for all business troubles of an internal nature, as well as
for many that have nothing to do with business.

These cartoons are sweet and clean and wholesome, very pleasant to the
palate and remarkably efficacious in chronic cases of indigestion and
disordered spleen. They clear the mind and restore business confidence.
They enrich the blood, the brain, the liver--and the purse. Mixed with
the wine of good sense they produce a volatile drink that sparkles and
effervesces into rippling mirth and bubbling laughter, a draught the
high Olympian gods might long for. Best of all, not a single pill is
bitter to the taste.

In short, the cartoonists of Seattle prove conclusively, so he who
smiles may read, that a laugh is worth a hundred groans in any market.
